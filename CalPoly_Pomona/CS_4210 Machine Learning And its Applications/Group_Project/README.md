Our group project for this class was to design a Machine Learning algorithm to classify posts (Tweets on Twitter) into a category of cyberbullying.

Only one person in our group did all of the programming as we had very little time to complete this project and he already created a previous project that was very similar.

My contribution to this project was on explaining the algorithms used, our results, and our attempt to perform grid searches to try and get better accuracies.
