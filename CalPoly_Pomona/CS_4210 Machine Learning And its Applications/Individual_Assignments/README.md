Each assignemnt dealt with some algorithm(s) of Machine Learning. 

The assignments had us do the associated calculations and/or algorithm steps by hand and than complete a given Python program to make the described ML algorithm work.

NOTE: The coding part was a 'fill-in the blank' style assignment. Some or most of the code was given and we had to research the apppropiate functions needed to complete the assignemnt.
