What to hand in :

If the assignment is handwritten, then scan all the pages and upload as PDF document or if unable to scan, then take high quality picture of each page, 
put all images together in a Word document (1 per page) and upload to BB.

If you have typed the assignment directly in word, please upload the word document or a pdf version of it.This is preferable but I know it is a 
bit more time consuming, especially if you are just taking images of your hand written work. 

Make sure your assignment has a cover page that has your name, course name and assignment number on it and please upload by the due date listed in BB.
