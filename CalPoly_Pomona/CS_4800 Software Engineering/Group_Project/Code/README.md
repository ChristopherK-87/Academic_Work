This folder contains the Python file that we created for our API that was hosted on AWS Lambda and was accessed through the Amazon API gateway.

My specific contribution was on creating SQL queries; I created the functions: fetch_all_records, fetch_single_record, fetch_multiple_records, new_record, and delete_records

Our Team manager in this project created the rest of the code and showed us how we can host it on AWS Lambda.
