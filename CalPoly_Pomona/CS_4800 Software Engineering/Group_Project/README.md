This class project was a multi-team effort to create a web-based and cloud-hosted predictor for California wildfires. There where three teams that collaborated to create this project; Web App (Front-end), Web Services (API), and AI/ML (Back-end).

I was part of the team that designed the API for the other two components. We used AWS to host our multi-team project.

The AWS_Web_Service_Team.pptx is our group presentation for the API we designed to facilitate communication between the Web App (Front-end) and AI/ML (Back-end) components.

The CS4800 Wildfire AI.pptx is the presentation for the AI/ML group of our class project. We did not work on their portion of the project other than to coordiate the requirements of our API.

The rest of the files are diagrams made by our team in relation to our project and the project as a whole, such as: data models, activity diagrams, project charters and others. Most of these files are rough drafts that I had saved for my viewing/reference but are close to our final versions of which I do not have copies of.

The code folder contains the Python file that we created and uploaded to AWS Lambda.
