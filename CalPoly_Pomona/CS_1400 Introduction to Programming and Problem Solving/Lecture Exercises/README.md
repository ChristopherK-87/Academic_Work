The exercises were from week 12 of the class. This is the only week in which I had code that was saved on my PC.

I do not remember if I had written code for the other weeks of that semester. 
This might have been an attempt to verify which students were present and attentive during the Zoom class session.

The code 'recursionExample.java' is from an unknown class session but was placed here as it was code that was written for this class.
